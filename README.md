# Flashcard-online
A website to host all your flashcards on without needing to create an account or pay. I added this to learn more about databases and relearn node.js

The link is currently live here: https://flashcard-online.herokuapp.com/. Check it out if you would like! 

It is an open space (meaning anybody that accesses the website will see the same things). I did this because I only intended for my class and teacher to use it, if at all. Please let me know if you would like to use it, I'll create a private room feature (no signing in required!).

In order to use this website, simply enter the name/topic of the flashcard in the first text area, the information that you want revealed in the second text area, and finally, the url to an image. I have not put file support for images yet, so you cannot upload personal images.  

Images are optional, so just leave the field blank if you would like to.

There is also a delete button at the bottom of the main screen. There, simply type in the name of the card you woudl like to delete and click the button. Make sure that the name of the card and the name you have entered match up EXACTLY. It is case and space sensitive. 

Please let me know if there are any problems! Happy studying!
